## Junior Hacker Recruitment Project

Welcome to the Junior Hacker Recruitment Project at BillTech! In this project, you'll demonstrate your skills in TypeScript, Node.js, SQL, and PostgreSQL. You'll also get a chance to engage in web scraping and reverse engineering. Your goal is to build a mini application that scrapes invoice data from a mock financial services website and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. The project is divided into tasks on a Kanban board. Let's get started and show us what you've got!
